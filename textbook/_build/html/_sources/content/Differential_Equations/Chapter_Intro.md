# Differential Equations

Differential equations arise in the mathematical modeling of a wide range of problems, ranging from science and engineering to economics and finance. Here we will consider *Ordinary Differential Equations* (ODEs), where the unknown function $y(t)$ depends on a single independent variable $t$.
