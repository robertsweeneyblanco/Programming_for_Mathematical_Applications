# Special Number Types

When performing computational work, it's crucial to be aware of potential **floating-point errors**. These are inaccuracies caused by the finite way computers store and handle numbers. This [link](http://www-users.math.umn.edu/~arnold//455.f96/disasters.html) highlights a few tragic, real-world disasters that occurred due to floating-point errors.

To avoid such issues, it's sometimes necessary to increase the **precision**, or the number of digits used to represent a number. This chapter introduces special number types that allow for arbitrarily high precision in calculations.

We will also discuss two other commonly used number types: **complex** and **rational** numbers. Just as mathematicians work with different sets of numbers (integers $\mathbb{Z}$, rationals $\mathbb{Q}$, reals $\mathbb{R}$, complex $\mathbb{C}$, etc.), it is essential to know how to work with their corresponding data types when programming.
