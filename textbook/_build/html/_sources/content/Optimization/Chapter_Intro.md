# Optimization

The goal of optimization is to maximize (or minimize) the value of a function (called objective function) subject to a number of restrictions (called constraints). It is of fundamental importance in wide variety of fields throughout science, engineering, finance.

Here we will give a brief overview on the manual implementation of *gradient-based optimizers* without constraints. We will also introduce one of the many Julia optimization packages, `Optim`.
