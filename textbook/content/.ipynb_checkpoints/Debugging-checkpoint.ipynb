    "This error is somewhat unique to Julia. Most other programming languages would report dividing a string by the integer zero as a syntax error, Julia specifically allows you to write such general code, but will only catch the error when you try and run it. We see that the error reports that on line 7 above, we are calling `divide_by_zero()` which tries to compute `String/Int64`, something that has not been programmed.\n",
    "\n",
    "This error can be fixed by writing that functionality ourselves using the tools we will explore in Section 11: Structs and Objects, or by not trying to divide a string by zero in the first place! This can be enforced by rewriting the function as follows:"

    "Debugging semantic errors might take up the majority of your time while programming, so it is important to set yourself up for success in expectation of these errors. Especially as you work on larger programs and projects, start with small test cases to confirm the logic of your program makes sense. Not to sound like a broken record, but modular programming will certainly help isolate the issues; if you have already tested most of your code successfully and can rely upon it, then you only have to struggle to debug the smaller pieces that fail the tests. \n",
    "\n",
    "While debugging, use `println` statements to see what is really going on. A simple tip that goes a long way: assume nothing is correct and slowly start to confirm that what you think is going on inside the program is actually going on by looking at a report of the variables. A more effective method than using print statements is to use a debugger. The IDE Atom allows you debug your code carefully, but Jupyter notebooks unfortunately do not play well with debuggers, so we won't discuss them too much in this course."
