# Random Numbers

This chapter introduces how to generate random numbers in Julia, covering essential distributions like the uniform (`rand`) and normal (`randn`). We will visualize these datasets using histograms, providing an intuitive look at powerful concepts like the Central Limit Theorem. These foundational skills are then applied to the powerful technique of **Monte Carlo simulation**. Through engaging examples like simulating card games and estimating $\pi$, you will see how randomness can be used to solve complex problems.
