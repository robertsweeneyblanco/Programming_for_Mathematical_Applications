# Strings and File Processing

So far, we have focused primarily on numerical data. However, a vast amount of the world's information is stored and communicated as **text**, from scientific datasets and literary works to the very code we write. This chapter introduces **strings**, Julia's fundamental data type for representing and manipulating text. You'll learn how to slice, search, combine, and transform strings, building a powerful toolkit for working with text-based information.

To make our programs truly useful, we need them to interact with data stored outside of the code itself. This is where **file processing** comes in. Learning to read from and write to files allows your programs to load experimental data, parse configuration settings, and save results for later use. By combining string manipulation with file I/O, you'll gain the essential skill of **parsing** - the process of turning raw text from a file into the structured, usable data needed for your mathematical applications.
