# Introduction to Julia

This chapter introduces the fundamentals of the Julia programming language, a powerful tool designed for scientific and mathematical computing. By the end of this section, you'll be able to write and execute your first lines of code to perform basic calculations.

While the core programming concepts we'll cover are transferable to nearly any language, the specific **syntax** and conventions discussed here are unique to Julia.
