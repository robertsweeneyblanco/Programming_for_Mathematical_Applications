    "A crucial skill you've hopefully started developing is **debugging**. Simply put, it's the process of finding and fixing errors until your code works as expected. In practice, debugging can sometimes feel like you're a detective in a crime movie where you are also the one who caused the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three main types of errors you'll encounter:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Syntax Errors:** The code violates the rules of the language (e.g., a typo or a missing parenthesis).\n",
    "* **Runtime Errors:** The code is syntactically correct but fails during execution (e.g., trying to divide by zero or accessing an out-of-bounds array index).\n",
    "* **Semantic Errors:** The code runs without crashing but produces the wrong result. These are often the trickiest, as the computer doesn't know your code isn't doing what you *intended*.\n",

    "## Syntax Errors\n",
    "Syntax errors are fundamental mistakes that prevent the Julia interpreter from understanding your code. Think of them as grammatical errors in a sentence; if the grammar is wrong, the meaning is lost.\n",
    "\n",
    "They are often caused by simple typos and are usually the easiest to fix. As you gain more experience, you'll make fewer of them, but they never disappear entirely! A good practice to minimize and isolate these errors is **modular programming**. In this course, that means writing small, focused functions that each accomplish a single task, often in separate notebook cells. This makes it much easier to pinpoint where an error is coming from.\n",
