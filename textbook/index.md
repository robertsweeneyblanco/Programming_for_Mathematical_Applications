# Programming for Mathematical Applications

### By Per-Olof Persson, Michael Franco, and Robert Sweeney Blanco

-----

## Description

This course is an introduction to computer programming, focusing on how to solve mathematical and scientific problems. We will first cover fundamental programming concepts like **variables**, **statements**, **loops**, **branches**, **functions**, **special data types**, and **composite data types and objects**.

You'll also learn to use key mathematical and scientific tools, including **arrays**, **floating-point numbers**, **plotting libraries**, and **symbolic algebra packages**. These concepts will be applied to a wide range of applications, such as number theory, combinatorics, statistical analysis, efficient algorithms, computational geometry, Fourier analysis, and optimization.

The course is primarily taught in the **Julia** programming language, though we will occasionally compare it with other languages.

## Additional Readings

  * **[Julia Docs]** [*The Official Julia Documentation*](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1). A comprehensive resource available for free online.

  * **[Think Julia]** [Think Julia: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist](https://benlauwens.github.io/ThinkJulia.jl/latest/book.html) by Ben Lauwens and Allen Downey. An excellent, free online book that introduces programming fundamentals from the ground up.

## Computing Resources

  * **Cloud Environment (Recommended)**
    Thanks to generous support from the Division of Data Sciences, you have access to a cloud-based Julia environment through the campus **[Datahub](https://julia.datahub.berkeley.edu)**. This platform runs Jupyter notebooks directly in your browser. Simply sign in with your CalNet ID to get started.

  * **Using Jupyter Notebooks**
    To help you get comfortable with the Jupyter environment, here are a few useful resources:

      * **Getting Started:** The official [Jupyter Notebook documentation](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebook.html#).
      * **Productivity:** A handy [keyboard shortcut cheat sheet](https://www.cheatography.com/weidadeyue/cheat-sheets/jupyter-notebook/pdf_bw/).
      * **Formatting:** A [Markdown cheat sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Here-Cheatsheet) for styling text and a guide for writing [mathematics using LaTeX](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics)

  * **Local Installation (Optional)**
    If you prefer to work on your own machine, you can install Julia locally:

    1.  Download and install the latest stable version from [julialang.org](https://julialang.org).
    2.  For a better development experience, we recommend installing [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) along with the official [Julia extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/julia).
    3.  To run notebooks locally, you will also need to install the `IJulia` package and other packages used in the course.
